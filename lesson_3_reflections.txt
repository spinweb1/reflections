When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with others, or perhaps to have a non-local backup.





Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

How would it know when to pull?  I may save a file, but not be done with the contents of a logical break.





Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: to make a clone on Github of someone else's repo
Clone: to pull a local copy of a repo to your computer from Github
Branch: to create a copy of existing code to modify or debug it




What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To keep track of the state of the remote for info on merging with local branches.





How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Fewer steps for really basic changes to one file (e.g., no need to set up a repo), but complex merging
and tracking everything would be much harder.






When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I guess if they are substantial.  Maybe if the Master branch is being updated?

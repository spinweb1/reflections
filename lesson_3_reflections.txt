When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with others, or perhaps to have a non-local backup.





Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

How would it know when to pull?  I may save a file, but not be done with the contents of a logical break.
